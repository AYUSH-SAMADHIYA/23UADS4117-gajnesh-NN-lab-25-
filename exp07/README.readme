Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of classifying medical images into different categories using a transfer learning approach with a pretrained ResNet-18 model.

Description of Model:
This project utilizes ResNet18, a convolutional neural network architecture pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. The model is fine-tuned by replacing its final fully connected layer to match the number of classes in the provided medical dataset.

Backbone: ResNet18 (pretrained)

Modification: Output layer adjusted for custom class count

Loss Function: Cross-Entropy Loss

Optimizer: Adam (learning rate = 0.001)

Description of Code:
Libraries Used: PyTorch, Torchvision, Matplotlib

Dataset Handling:
Images are loaded from a directory structure with train and val subfolders.
Data augmentation (e.g., random horizontal flip) and normalization are applied.

Model Definition:
A pretrained ResNet-18 model is loaded.
The final FC layer is modified to output predictions based on the number of classes in the dataset.

Training Loop:
Training is done for 10 epochs.
Tracks training and validation loss and accuracy.
Best-performing model on the validation set is saved.

Visualization:
A loss curve is plotted at the end of training to visualize training progress.



Performance Evaluation:
Training & Validation Metrics:

Accuracy and loss are printed for both training and validation phases across epochs.
The best model is selected based on highest validation accuracy.

Visualization:

A loss curve is generated to track the decrease in loss over training epochs
Actual performance metrics (accuracy, loss) may vary depending on the dataset quality and number of samples.


My Comments:

The modular structure of the training function makes it easy to extend and experiment with different models or training strategies.

For further improvements, you might consider:

Adding test set evaluation
Experimenting with deeper networks (e.g., ResNet-50)
Implementing learning rate scheduling or early stopping

Model Limitations:
If the dataset has fewer images or uneven classes, the model might get confused.
ResNet-18 is not super deep. It works, but better models exist.
Didnâ€™t handle bad or wrong images in the dataset.
