## OBJECTIVE:
To implement a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using NumPy and demonstrate its ability to learn the XOR Boolean function. XOR is a non-linearly separable problem that requires at least one hidden layer to be correctly classified.

## Description of the Model:

A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network consisting of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. It uses non-linear activation functions to learn complex patterns in data. For this task, we implement an MLP with:
-Input layer: Two neurons representing the binary inputs.
-Hidden layer: Four neurons implementing AND, OR, and NOR functions.
-Output layer: A single neuron combining hidden outputs to compute XOR.
-Activation Function: Uses a step function to determine output.
-Forward Propagation: Computes output at each layer using dot products and activation functions.


## Description of Code:

1.Perceptron Function: Uses a step activation function to determine the neuron’s output.

2.Hidden Layer Processing: Implements four perceptrons with pre-defined weights and biases to mimic logic functions.

3.Output Layer Processing: Combines hidden layer outputs using another perceptron to compute XOR.

4.Testing: The model is tested on all XOR truth table inputs and prints the final results.


## Performance Evaluation:
- Accuracy: The model correctly classifies XOR inputs, proving that the perceptron-based MLP is capable of solving the problem.
- Loss Reduction: Since a step function is used, loss is not explicitly calculated, but correct predictions indicate effective learning.
- Confusion Matrix (Optional): A table showing correct and incorrect classifications could be implemented.
- Graphical Representation (Optional): A plot of decision boundaries could help visualize how the perceptron separates classes.


## MY COMMENTS:

(a) Limitations:
- The model is manually designed with fixed weights and biases, which does not generalize well to other problems.
- The perceptron’s step function limits gradient-based learning methods.


(b) Scope for Improvement:

Implement a trainable version using backpropagation to adjust weights.

Use sigmoid or ReLU for hidden layers to enable smooth learning.

Extend the model to classify multi-class logic functions beyond XOR.
